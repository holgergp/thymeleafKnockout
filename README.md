Sample application to showcase Spring MVC/Thymeleaf and Knockout.js interoperation.

For simplicities sake this is build with Spring Boot. I assume you have Java 8 installed.

I manage my JavaScript dependencies with npm. So this example assumes you have node and npm installed.
Please run <code>npm install</code> first

To start the application run <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code>
